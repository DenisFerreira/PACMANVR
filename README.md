# PACMAN VR

Study project developed in partnership with Thiago Paiva and Julio Cesar in free time in the company LSI.
The goal of the study was to learn various technologies such as Unyt3D, C #, javascript and virtual reality.
In the game, we must find treasures hidden randomly inside the labyrinth while we flee from monsters that persecute us. In a poorly lit dungeon, the player must use his hearing to know how close he is to the monsters and thus choose the best path.
